      This policy will verify that S3 buckets are using encryption so that
      sensitive data is secure at rest. Many regulatory and compliance standards
      require data encryption to be enabled across resources. If any S3 buckets
      are found without encryption, the default server side encryption will be
      enabled and a notification sent. This policy helps with compliance
      standards such as APRA, GDPR, HIPAA, MAS, NIST 800-53 rev4 and PCI DSS by
      identifying and remediating the non-compliant S3 buckets.

  description: &description |
      S3 buckets which are not utilizing Server Side Encryption (SSE) will be
      identified, modified to use the aws/s3 KMS key, and the impacted users
      will be notified.

      S3 buckets should be using Server Side Encryption (SSE) for secure data at
      rest. The identified S3 buckets were not using SSE and have now been modified
      to utilize SSE with the aws/s3 KMS key.
